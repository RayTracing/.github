The RayTracing GitHub Org
====================================================================================================

This GitHub organization is host to the [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_][rtw] series on GitHub. We are
host to the following repositories:

[raytracing.github.io][repo-rtw]
---------------------------------
This is the primary repository of the three books in the _Ray Tracing in One Weekend_ book series.
All three books are available online at https://raytracing.github.io. As this is our primary
repository, you'll find the most active traffic and [discussions][rtw-discussions] there.


[gpu-tracing][repo-gpu]
------------------------
A new book currently in development by [Arman Uguray][], covering ray tracing on GPU systems.


Deprecated Repositories
------------------------
For historical preservation, we have the original three repositories of the _Ray Tracing in One
Weekend_ books as they were in the process of moving from Peter Shirley's personal source to the
public repositories hosted on GitHub. They are:

  - [InOneWeekend][archive1]
  - [TheNextWeek][archive2]
  - [TheRestOfYourLife][archive3]

These repositories are read-only.

If you have any questions, please forward them to [Steve Hollasch][] or [Trevor David Black][].
